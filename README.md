# 4wayIO-CAN-Modbus
4 230V Input 4 Relay Output CAN Bus Modbus SmartHome Project

This projects has started because i wanted to make my windowblinds smart. I allready got a RaspberryPi with IOBroker running, wich interfaces my heating controll via CAN Bus. 
I designed this PCB to go on the same bus but added a RS485 Transceiver to also be able to interface Modbus standard.
